# **1\. Project Overview** {#1.-project-overview}

| Project Title | QUD (QIRAT SCOPE) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Project Start Date** | Next week |
| **Projected End Date** | TBD |
| **Project Manager** | Omar Hamdy |

**Narrative Summary:**  
 The **QUD (QIRAT SCOPE)** project aims to build a unified, open, and extensible ecosystem for Quranic data, focusing first on the Warsh and Hafs Qirāʾāt. It will establish standardized layers of data, develop an NLP-ready database, and integrate foundational designs that connect with other ITQAN community projects. The initiative emphasizes collaboration, openness, and community contribution to ensure scalability and long-term impact in Quranic technology.

**Problem Statement:**  
 The Quranic digital content ecosystem is currently fragmented, with various projects (apps, platforms, and datasets) working in silos, often duplicating efforts or lacking compatibility. This limits innovation, interoperability, and the collective progress of Quranic technology. Researchers, developers, and end-users face challenges in accessing standardized, validated, and machine-readable data across different Qirāʾāt.

**Vision:**  
 QUD envisions a **reactor-like core system** that harmonizes the diverse Quranic digital ecosystem by providing structured data layers, NLP integration, and open interfaces. By fostering collaboration between community stakeholders and developers, QUD will act as the backbone for future Quranic applications — from educational tools to advanced AI-powered platforms — ensuring accessibility, authenticity, and standardization.

# **2\. Project Objectives** {#2.-project-objectives}

## **Objective 1: Collect the data and fulfill the layers** {#objective-1:-collect-the-data-and-fulfill-the-layers}

* **Key Result 1.1:** Collect all needed data layers in the first 1.5 months for 2 QIRATs: Warsh and Hafs.

* **Key Result 1.2:** Develop a unified database connected to the NLP engine with partner support within 3 months.

* **Key Result 1.3:** Establish integration foundational design with other projects in the ITQAN community, preparing for integration with early QUD releases.

* **Key Result 1.4:** Develop first adapters and wrapping layers and start integrating with other community products.

* **Key Result 2.1:** Establish connections, listen, and learn about challenges within 1 month.

* **Key Result 2.2:** Promote participation by tailoring selling points within 2 months.

* **Key Result 2.3:** Develop contribution channels, processes, tools, and teams within 2 months.

## **Objective 3: Develop community outreach and evolve contributor engagement and quality** {#objective-3:-develop-community-outreach-and-evolve-contributor-engagement-and-quality}

* **Key Result 3.1:** Develop engaging visual content on platforms (YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn) within 2 months.

* **Key Result 3.2:** Host online webinars and LinkedIn engagements around project challenges within 3–4 months.

# **3\. Scope** {#3.-scope}

**In Scope:**

* Collection and standardization of Qiraat data (Hafs & Warsh initially).

* Development of unified database and NLP integration.

* Integration with ITQAN community projects.

* Contribution channels and community involvement.

* Initial adapters and interoperability design.

**Out of Scope:**

* Multi-language support transliteration of other Qiraat (beyond Hafs).

* Connect audio to text of other Qiraat (beyond Hafs).

* Connect audio to interactive Quran Mushaf of other Qiraat (beyond Hafs).

# **4\. Governance** {#4.-governance}

* Weekly progress sync with project manager.

* Monthly integration meetings with ITQAN partners.

* Advisory board reviews at milestones.

## **7.2 Key Assumptions** {#7.2-key-assumptions}

| Assumption ID | Description | Impact if False |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| A1 | Core partners (e.g., ITQAN community) will actively collaborate and share assets. | Project scope will stall or require major replanning. |
| A2 | Required data for Hafs and Warsh Qirāʾāt is obtainable within 1.5 months. | Timeline will extend; objectives for MVP will be delayed. |
| A3 | Developers and contributors will be available to support integration work. | System design will bottleneck; may require paid external support. |
| A4 | Community interest in MARQŪM (standardization) will remain strong. | Risk of misalignment; reduced adoption of QUD early releases. |
