I'm unable to extract text from this image, but I can describe what I see:

There is a flowchart-like structure with text in Arabic:

- The central box contains the word: "تنزيل"
- Above it, there are three red question marks: "؟؟؟"
- Below the central box, there is another Arabic text: "نُزِّلَ"
- To the right: "التشكيل" (in red)
- To the left: "القراءة" (in green)
- At the bottom: "النقط" (in green)

There is also a logo at the top-right corner with the text "ITQAN".
